#  Soil Collection Mechanism for Mars Rover-CAD

## Overview
This project presents a **mechanized soil collection system** for Mars rovers. The design enables **efficient sample extraction, storage, and sealing** while ensuring minimal contamination from Martian dust. The system is optimized for **planetary exploration missions** where precise soil analysis is required.

The mechanism employs an **auger conveyor system** to efficiently transport collected soil into a secure storage chamber. The auger system ensures controlled soil movement, minimizing loss and maintaining sample integrity under Martian conditions.

Developed in **SolidWorks**, the project includes **CAD files, a detailed report with justifications, and an animation** showcasing the mechanism in action.

## Features
- **Automated soil collection** using an **auger conveyor system** for efficient material transport.
- **Secure storage** with an airtight chamber to preserve sample integrity.
- **Material Selection:**
  - **Frame & Auger Conveyor:** Aluminum alloy for lightweight durability.
  - **Sealing Gasket:** Silicone for airtight containment.
- **Complete Design Package:**
  - ✅ **CAD files (.sldprt, .stepAP214)**
  - ✅ **Engineering report (PDF) with justifications and references**
  - ✅ **Animation demonstrating soil collection process**
- **All components available for purchase online in BD**
